/* You are given a license key represented as a string s that consists of only alphanumeric characters and dashes. The string is separated into n + 1 groups by n dashes.
You are also given an integer k.  We want to reformat the string s such that each group contains exactly k characters, except for the first group,
which could be shorter than k but still must contain at least one character. Furthermore, there must be a dash inserted between two groups,
and you should convert all lowercase letters to uppercase.  Return the reformatted license key. */
